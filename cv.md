3. I want to enter a new world for myself. The world of IT. Get a new job, do useful things. When I see a goal, I'm ready to move mountains to achieve it. Diligent, effective. I'm a little lazy, so I'm trying to do everything well right away, so as not to redo it. I do not stop at the achieved result, it is always possible to do better.
4. At the moment, I have completed HTML basics courses
5. Sample code.

```<main>
<section class="more">
<h2>ИНФОРМАЦИЯ</h2>
<article class="article-block">
<h3>УСЛУГИ</h3>
<p>Описание</p>
<a href="/">Ссылка</a>
</article>
</section>
</main>
```

6. I don't have any work experience, but I hope that it will appear soon so that in the future it can be shared.
7. Graduated from BSU in 2016. I am currently studying at RSSCHOOL
8. English is still weak, between A1 and A2. But I have set myself a goal to put A2 in the near future
